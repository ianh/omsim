to use, try

  make run-tests && ./run-tests

to run some tests, or

  make omsim && ./omsim <path to .puzzle> <path to .solution>

to simulate a particular solution. also,

  make libverify.so

builds a shared library with an API designed for bots to use (see verifier.h for
documentation).

the following aren't implemented yet:
- the "grabbed molecule can't be moved in multiple directions" error
- two atoms occupying the same space (e.g. the surrender flare overlap solution)
- "spooky action at a distance" via conduit cloning

the following issues are known:
- track reset is different from the game in certain situations (see
  test/not-working-yet/overlapping-track-reset)

these lists should get shorter over time. feel free to file github issues for
any other bugs you find!
